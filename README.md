# plant-guzzle

This is a simple plant watering system for plants that are indoors using an arduino uno. This project is just a hobbyist project.
It uses a variety of different sensors (soil moisture, light, humidity/temperature).

There is also data logging that is going to be added soon (with the adafruit data logging shield (SD card)).

Sensors used for this project (would be compatible with similar sensors):

- Arduino Compatible Analog Light Sensor (https://www.buyapi.ca/product/arduino-compatible-analog-light-sensor/)
- Arduino Compatible Digital Temperature Humidity Sensor Module (DHT11) (https://www.buyapi.ca/product/arduino-compatible-digital-temperature-humidity-sensor-module-dht11-with-indicator-led/)
- SparkFun Soil Moisture Sensor (https://www.buyapi.ca/product/sparkfun-soil-moisture-sensor-with-screw-terminals/)

Those sensors can obviously be provided from different places and the code would probably be compatible with any similar sensors.
